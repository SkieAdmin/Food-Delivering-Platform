● I've reviewed our last conversation where I built the complete GoCotano Food Delivery Platform. The conversation shows that I successfully created a production-ready food delivery application with:

  What was built:
  - Full-stack Node.js application with Express.js
  - MySQL database with Prisma ORM
  - Light blue & orange themed UI
  - Authentication with SMS OTP (Twilio)
  - Multi-role system (Customer, Restaurant, Driver)
  - PayPal payment integration
  - Google Maps tracking
  - Real-time updates with Socket.IO
  - 50+ project files including controllers, views, routes, services

  Current status:
  - All core files created
  - Database schema ready
  - Sample seed data prepared
  - Documentation complete

  I'm ready for your further instructions. What would you like me to help you with next?

> Create a comprehensive Food Delivery Platform for the Philippines market with the following architecture:
